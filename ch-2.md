# Chapter 2: Building Abstractions with Data

Why do we want compound data? (Same reason we want compound procedures):

- **To elevate the conceptual level at which we can design our
 program**: Rise above the conceptual level of primitives. Represent
 compound/complex data as a conceptual unit in itself (that can be
 manipulated as a unit). For example, instead of representing and
 manipulating rational numbers as two numbers (a numerator and
 denominator), you represent and manipulate them as just a rational
